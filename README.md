# Mining-Quality-Prediction-Using-Machine-and-Deep-Learning
Now we will build a machine and deep learning models to predict the percentage of Silica Concentrate in the Iron ore concentrate per minute.
This project could be practically used in Mining Industry to get the % Silica Concentrate at a much faster rate compared to the traditional methods. In this hands-on project, we will complete the following tasks:

Understand the problem statement and business case  

Import libraries/datasets and perform preliminary data processing

 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis

Perform Data Visualization

Create Training and Testing Datasets

Train and Evaluate a Gradient Boosting Regressor Model

 Train and Evaluate a Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressor Models

Train and Evaluate an Artificial Neural Network Model

Calculate and Print Regression model KPIs

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a virtual workspace with all the required software pre-installed.
